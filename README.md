# testIT WebTester
testIT WebTester is a web-application UI test automation framework based on Selenium (http://www.seleniumhq.org).

It is the product of years of consulting experience in various projects and aims at providing a very intuitive, declarative and extendable API for writing programmatic UI tests in Java.

### Features
- Page Object Pattern as it's main focus
- Functional page elements instead of generic WebElement API
- Script style testing support using Ad-Hoc element identification API
- Event System for traceability and custom action
- Option to highlight used elements as a visual debugging support
- Support modules for the integration with frameworks like: assertj, hamcrest, junit, spring
- If you must, Selenium is always just a method call away.
